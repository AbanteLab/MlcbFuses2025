Multimodal genotype-phenotype prediction of Huntington's disease age of onset (submitted to MLCB 2025).

This repository contains the code and resources for our study on predicting age of onset (AO) in Huntingtonâ€™s disease (HD) using genotype data from Enroll-HD. The project benchmarks linear, tree-based, and graph-based models to identify genetic modifiers (GeMs) of AO, and a novel application of Borzoi's variant effect scoring prediction as features for AO classification. Key features include:

- Tree-based methods for accurate and interpretable GeM discovery
- Gene-specific variational autoencoders (VAEs) for genotype compression
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) using protein-interaction networks
- Integration of gene expression predictions from the Borzoi genomic language model
- Context-dependent analysis of GeMs based on CAG repeat length
